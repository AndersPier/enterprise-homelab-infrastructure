## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Internet → UCG Ultra (Router/Firewall) → Infrastructure Traefik → {
                                                                    Dokploy Instances (Dev/Staging/Prod)
                                                                    AdGuard DNS (HA Pair)
                                                                    Monitoring Stack

### Key Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose | High Availability |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Network Gateway** | Ubiquiti Cloud Gateway Ultra | Routing, Firewall, VPN | Single point (consider backup) |
| **DNS/Ad Blocking** | AdGuard Home | Network-wide ad blocking, DNS | Active/Passive cluster |
| **Virtualization** | Proxmox VE 8.4+ | VM/Container hosting | Clustering support |
| **Container Platform** | Dokploy | Application deployment | Multi-environment |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Traefik v3.0+ | Load balancing, SSL termination | HA with multiple instances |
| **Storage** | QNAP TS-433 | NFS, S3-compatible storage | RAID protection |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus/Grafana | Infrastructure monitoring | Redundant collectors |
| **Backup** | Multiple strategies | Data protection | Local + offsite |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Hardware Requirements:**
- [ ] Ubiquiti Cloud Gateway Ultra configured and accessible
- [ ] Proxmox VE 8.4+ installed on dedicated hardware (min 16GB RAM, SSD storage)
- [ ] QNAP TS-433 (or compatible) with Container Station enabled
- [ ] Managed switch with VLAN support (Ubiquiti Switch Flex 2.5G recommended)
- [ ] UPS for power protection (recommended)

**Network Requirements:**
- [ ] Static IP addresses for critical infrastructure
- [ ] Domain name with DNS provider supporting API access (for SSL certificates)
- [ ] Internet connection with sufficient bandwidth

**Software Requirements:**
- [ ] Basic networking knowledge (VLANs, subnetting)
- [ ] Understanding of Docker and container concepts
- [ ] Familiarity with Linux command line

### 1. Initial Setup

Clone this repository to your Proxmox host:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndersPier/enterprise-homelab-infrastructure.git
cd enterprise-homelab-infrastructure
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment

Copy and edit the configuration template:

```bash
cp config/homelab.conf.example config/homelab.conf
vim config/homelab.conf
```

**Critical Configuration Items:**
- Domain name and DNS API credentials (for SSL certificates)
- Network IP ranges and VLAN assignments (or single network setup)
- Email addresses for monitoring alerts
- Backup destinations and retention policies

### 3. Choose Your Network Architecture

**Option A: Advanced VLAN Setup (Recommended for Production)**
- Requires managed switch with VLAN support
- Full network segmentation and isolation between environments
- More complex but provides better security and performance isolation

**Option B: Single Network Setup (Simpler)**
- Uses single network (192.168.1.0/24) with static IP assignments
- Easier to set up and manage, suitable for smaller deployments
- Still provides excellent functionality with simplified networking

### 4. Run the Installation

**Review Before Executing:**
```bash
# Verify your configuration
cat config/homelab.conf

# Check network connectivity
ping 8.8.8.8

# Ensure sufficient storage space
df -h
```

**Execute Installation:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git curl wget jq nfs-common

# Run the main installation script
sudo ./scripts/install-infrastructure.sh

# Follow the interactive prompts for:
# - Network configuration choice (VLAN vs single network)
# - AdGuard Home setup
# - Dokploy instance deployment
# - Monitoring stack installation
```

### 5. Post-Installation Steps

1. **Configure external access** using the UCG Ultra configuration guide
2. **Set up DNS records** for your domain (see `config/dns-records.txt`)
3. **Deploy your first application** via Dokploy web interface
4. **Review monitoring dashboards** to ensure everything is functioning
